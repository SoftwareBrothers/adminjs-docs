# Writing your own features

As I mentioned the feature is a simple function which returns [ResourceOptions](https://github.com/SoftwareBrothers/adminjs/blob/master/src/backend/decorators/resource/resource-options.interface.ts). Simple as that.&#x20;

But since features can be chained they also take [ResourceOptions](https://github.com/SoftwareBrothers/adminjs/blob/master/src/backend/decorators/resource/resource-options.interface.ts) generated by the previous features as a parameter.&#x20;

Simple feature implementation (idea):

```javascript
const feature = (prevResourceOptions) {
  return {
    ...prevResourceOptions,
    actions: {
      ...prevResourceOptions.actions,
      edit: {
        ...(prevResourceOptions.actions && prevResourceOptions.actions.edit),
        //..
      }
      //..
    }
  }
}

export { feature }
```

As you can see, in the example above, that you have to take care of merging previous options, which could be problematic. Fortunately AdminJS gives you the helper functions for that:&#x20;

* factory function [buildFeature](https://github.com/SoftwareBrothers/adminjs/blob/master/src/backend/utils/build-feature/build-feature.ts) and
* optional helper [mergeResourceOptions](https://github.com/SoftwareBrothers/adminjs/blob/master/src/backend/decorators/resource/resource-options.interface.ts), when you need more control.

&#x20;This is how a feature could look when we use [buildFeature](https://github.com/SoftwareBrothers/adminjs/blob/master/src/backend/utils/build-feature/build-feature.ts) function:

```javascript
const { buildFeature } = require('adminjs')

const feature = buildFeature({
  actions: {
    before: myBeforeHook
  }
})
```
