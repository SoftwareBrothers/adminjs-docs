# Generate API Key & Secret

Cloud Hosting service allows you to deploy your applications using a CLI. To use the CLI, you need an API Key & API Secret. To generate these, make sure your application has already been approved by an administrator.

Once your application is approved, you should see an option to generate an API Key & Secret next to your application.

Select "Generate API Key" and you should soon see a new screen which allows you to download your API Key/Secret pair in a text file.

Once you download the file, you can proceed to [deploy your application](deploying-the-application-using-cli.md) using API Key/Secret pair.

Choosing to "Generate API Key" again invalidates existing API Key/Secret pair.
{% endhint %}

You can view your API Key anytime in your application's details, but if you lose your API Secret you must regenerate both API Key & Secret.
